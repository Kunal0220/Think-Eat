# Think-Eat
A Fitness cum Recipe Website Build on MERN

To start the app , in terminal, navigate to the client folder , 
first start the client side by typing in `npm start`

Then to start the server , in a new terminal , navigate to Server folder ,
then start the server by typing in `npx nodemon app.js` (or how ever nodemon starts for you , for me this is the command , only one thing that the file name is app.js)

You can test the WebSite (Without Backend) here https://64ed9da77b7edf2b67b5a214--beamish-youtiao-ee04e9.netlify.app/

Thank You :)
